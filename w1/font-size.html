		<h1>John F. Kennedy</h1>
		<p>John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 â€“ November 22, 1963), commonly referred to by his initials JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. Kennedy also avoided any significant increase in the American presence in Vietnam, refusing to commit combat troops and keeping the level of others, mostly military advisors, to only 16,000, compared to the 536,000 troops committed by his successor, Lyndon Johnson, by 1968.</p>

		<p>Kennedy's time in office is also marked by high tensions with Communist states, particularly Cuba. His administration subsequently rejected plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false-flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba. He participated in what was often termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is seen by many historians as the closest the human race has ever come to war featuring the use of nuclear weapons on both or multiple sides.</p>
		<p>Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested that afternoon and determined to have fired shots that hit the President from a sixth floor window of the Texas School Book Depository. Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby mortally wounded Oswald two days later in a jail corridor. The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin, but its report was sharply criticized.</p>
