In the (current) five seasons, John has encountered various personal and professional problems, testing his limits as both a doctor and human being.

		<p class="t">As the show further progresses, John's personal and private life becomes increasingly entwined with his work. He begins to face difficult ethical dilemmas and has to make some very difficult decisions. Some have often had extreme and unforeseen consequences. However, no matter the number of challenges he faces, John remains committed to his work, even if it means putting his own safety and well-being on the line. In the later seasons, things get more interesting as John encounters more characters. In the last episode, John questions where his journey will take him next.</p>
